Addendum Begins
This patient has had a CT scan performed on  mm/dd/yy, although
images are no longer available a report is available and describe  a
right paravertebral mass spanning in the cranial caudal dimension
over approximately 11 cm, the appearance was consistent with a cystic
loculation with some calcium deposit as described on the current
study.  Based on the description, today's images as well as some
chest x-rays from yyyy compared to the most recent chest x-ray dated
mm/dd /yy there is no significant change therefore unlikely to
explain the patient's symptoms.

IMPRESSION: The mass visualized on the plain film represent a cystic
extrapulmonary fluid collection located in the cul-de-sac posteriorly
and medially on the right.  There is calcification within this
collection which is of uncertain clinical significance.  This most
likely represent a postpneumonic pleural effusion that is loculated
and unresolved.  Pulmonary and/or thoracic surgery consultation
recommended.
 
There is stigmata of from prior granulomatous disease with two
calcified granulomas , one in the right upper lobe and one in the
left lower lobe.
 
There is a partially visualized left renal, upper upper pole
partially calcified mass measuring 14-mm for which further
investigation is recommended with CT IVP and urology consultation.
